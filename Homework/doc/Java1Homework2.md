# Java-1 Homework-2

* Please find attached pdf file named "12023 Harmoney School Houston.pdf", and use String.format() we have learned in our class, do as much as you could to solve each math problem. If you stuck anywhere, put in your homework, let me know which one you cannot do. Keep in mind, Java can do all of the math with no problem at all, maybe in the different way.

## Here is a sample code

```java
public class Homework1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 2020;
		int b = 20;
		System.out.println("01: 2020 - 20 = " + (a-b));
		a = 494;
		b = 118;
		System.out.println("02: 494 + 118 = " + (a+b));
		System.out.println("03: I don't know how to do it.");
		a = 60;
		b = 5;
		System.out.println("04: 60 / 5 = " + (a/b));
	
	}

}

```

the output looks something like:

```
01: 2020 - 20 = 2000
02: 494 + 118 = 612
03: I don't know how to do it.
04: 60 / 5 = 12
```
